# HeatCalendar

* This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 17.3.6.
* Visual inspiration is from Github's contributions heatcalendar.
* Backend will be built in the future, but for now, a (very) dummy data generation is done on the frontend via simple service.

## Development server

* Run `ng serve` for a dev server.
* Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`.
* The application will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Build

* Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.

## Running unit tests

* Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

* Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via a platform of your choice. To use this command, you need to first add a package that implements end-to-end testing capabilities.

## Goals

* Getting good grasp on Angular framework and how to structure projects while using it.
* Getting good grasp on Typescript.
* Avoiding any 3rd party libraries as long as it goes.

## Step by step what have I learned about Angular so far.

* Basic understanding of Angular components, services, directives.
* CommonModule directives
* Dependency injection / Inputs / Outputs
* Reactivity / RxJS
* Subscriptions, BehaviourSubjects, Observables / Streams
* Signals
